8423275,Treatment of allergic rhinitis with intranasal corticosteroids in patients with mild asthma: effect on lower airway responsiveness,"The effect of treatment of allergic rhinitis with intranasal corticosteroids on lower airway responsiveness was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Twenty-one young patients with perennial allergic rhinitis and asthma, with documented lower airway hyperresponsiveness (PC20 methacholine < 8 mg/ml), were treated with intranasal aqueous beclomethasone dipropionate and placebo, each given for 4 weeks. Patients recorded rhinitis and asthma symptom scores and monitored peak expiratory flow rates every morning and evening. Patients recorded global assessment of rhinitis and global asthma symptom scores at the beginning and end of each treatment. PC20 methacholine was performed at baseline and at the end of each treatment period. Intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate significantly reduced global rhinitis symptom scores (p = 0.05) after 4 weeks of treatment. Global asthma scores did not change significantly (p = 0.2). Geometric mean PC20 methacholine improved significantly after 4 weeks of intranasal beclomethasone, but not after placebo (p = 0.04). Daily morning and evening rhinitis symptom scores were lower in patients treated with intranasal corticosteroids over the first 4 weeks of treatment, but carryover effect of steroids precluded comparative analysis of the second 4-week block (morning p = 0.06, evening p = 0.03). Morning asthma scores tended to decrease (p = 0.07). Evening asthma scores were significantly decreased at weeks 2 and 3 (p = 0.001, p = 0.02, respectively). No change in peak expiratory flow rate was seen. This study confirms that treatment of inflammation in the upper airways indirectly improves asthma symptoms and decreases bronchial hyperreactivity. Ignoring inflammation in the upper airway may lead to suboptimal results in asthma treatment.",1,1,1,0,0,3
9744142,Once-daily budesonide: 400 micrograms once daily is as effective as 200 micrograms twice daily in controlling childhood asthma. PETITE Research Group,"One hundred and sixty seven children on 0-200 microgram/day of inhaled steroid with asthma symptoms and sub-optimal peak flow values (less than 90% of that predicted for their height) were randomly allocated either 400 microgram once daily (nocte with placebo o.m.) or 200 mircrogram twice daily of budesonide Turbohaler for 8 weeks. Bronchdilator usage and symptoms were reduced in both groups at 4 and 8 weeks compared with baseline. There was a significant increase within both groups in morning and evening PEF after 4 and 8 weeks. The increase in evening PEF after 8 weeks was greater in the once-daily group than in the twice-daily group but there were no other significant differences between the groups (morning: +24.6 l/min vs 15.2 l/min, p = 0.059; evening: + 19.7 l/min vs +8.31 l/min; p = 0.013). Budesonide Turbohaler 400 microgram once daily is therefore as effective as 200 microgram twice daily in achieving asthma control in children.",1,1,,,,2
9864004,Clinical efficacy of low-dose inhaled budesonide once or twice daily in children with mild asthma not previously treated with steroids,"The aim of the present study was to examine the efficacy of low-dose inhaled budesonide (BUD) administered via Turbuhaler once or twice daily on symptoms, lung function and bronchial hyperreactivity in children with mild asthma. One hundred and sixty-three children (mean age 9.9 yrs, 56 females/107 males) with mild asthma (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 103% of predicted, morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) 87% pred, reversibility in FEV1 3%, fall in FEV1 after exercise 10.4% from pre-exercise value) and not previously treated with inhaled steroids, were included in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. After a two-week run-in period, the children received inhaled BUD 100 microg or 200 microg once daily in the morning, 100 microg twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks. Exercise and methacholine challenges were performed before and at the end of treatment. After 12 weeks of therapy, the fall in FEV1 after an exercise test was significantly less in all three BUD groups (43-5.1%) than in the placebo group (8.6%). Bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine with the provocative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 decreased significantly in the BUD 100 microg twice-daily group compared with placebo (ratio at the end of treatment 156%). Changes in baseline lung function (FEV1 and PEF) were less marked than changes in bronchial responsiveness. In conclusion, low doses of inhaled budesonide, given once or twice daily, provided protection against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in children with mild asthma and near normal lung function.",1,1,,,,3
9821415, Adverse effect of inhaled budesonide (800 μgr) on growth and collagen turnover in children with asthma: a double-blind comparison of once-daily versus twice-daily administration,"Background: Twice-daily administration of inhaled budesonide (400 micrograms) suppresses short-term growth in children with asthma.Objective: To compare short-term growth and markers of collagen turnover during treatment with 800 micrograms of inhaled budesonide administered once daily in the morning and 400 micrograms administered twice daily.Patients: Twenty-four children with asthma aged 5.6 to 12.5 years.Setting: An outpatient secondary referral center.Methods: A randomized, double-blind, crossover trial with 2 treatment periods of 4 weeks was conducted, and growth was assessed with a knemometer. The carboxy terminal propeptide of type I procollagen, the amino terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), the carboxy terminal pyridinoline cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen, the amino terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), and urinary pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline were evaluated.Results: Mean lower leg growth rate (P = .04), PINP (P = .03), and PIIINP (P < .01) were suppressed during twice-daily administration of budesonide, 400 micrograms. Otherwise, no statistically significant differences were detected.Conclusions: As compared with 400 micrograms of inhaled budesonide administered twice daily, 800 micrograms administered once daily in the morning has a sparing effect on short-term growth and collagen turnover.",1,1,,,,3
10536064,Efficacy of once-daily versus twice-daily administration of budesonide by turbuhaler in children with stable asthma,"We evaluated the efficacy of once-daily versus twice-daily treatment with budesonide, delivered by a Turbuhaler(R), in the management of children with stable asthma in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study involving 206 children (age 5-15 years). After a 2-week run-in period during which the children were maintained on their usual dose of budesonide (200 microg or 400 microg/day), patients were randomized to receive the same daily dose in either two daily administrations (morning and evening) or as a single dose in the morning over a period of 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). The mean morning PEF during the run-in phase was 271 L/min in patients randomized to once-daily treatment and 264 L/min in those randomized to twice-daily treatment. The mean change from baseline to the last 2 weeks of the treatment period in the two groups was -0.3 L/min (95% confidence limits -6.6 to +6.0) and 2.5 L/min (-4.3 to +9.3). The estimated difference between the groups was -2.8 L/min, with 90% confidence limits of -10.4 + 4.5; these were close to the limits regarded as indicative of equivalence (-10 to +10), and hence the difference was not regarded as clinically relevant. Similarly, there were no significant differences between the groups in regard to secondary efficacy measures such as spirometric tests and symptom scores. Both treatments were well tolerated. We conclude that once-daily administration of budesonide by Turbuhaler(R) is as effective as twice-daily treatment in the management of stable asthma in children treated with inhaled steroids at doses of 200-400 microg/day.",1,1,,,,3
9925834,"A multiple–dosing, placebo–controlled study of budesonide inhalation suspension given once or twice daily for treatment of persistent asthma in young children and infants","Rationale: Topical antiinflammatory medications such as inhaled corticosteroids are recommended for therapy of asthma, but no formulation suitable for administration to infants and young children is available in the United States.Methods: This was a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study comparing the efficacy and safety of four dosing regimens of bude-sonide inhalation suspension (BIS) or placebo in 480 asthmatic infants and children (64% boys), ages 6 months to 8 years, with moderate persistent asthma. Approximately 30% of children were previously on inhaled corticosteroids that were discontinued before the study. Active treatments were comprised of BIS 0.25 mg once daily (QD), 0.25 mg twice a day (BID), 0.5 mg BID, or 1.0 mg QD. Efficacy was assessed by twice daily recording at home of asthma symptom scores and use of rescue medication, and discontinuation from the study because of worsening asthma and/or a requirement for systemic steroids. Peak flow measurements were recorded twice daily on diary and spirometry was recorded at clinic visits for those children able to perform these tests. Safety was assessed by reported adverse events and by cortisol testing (adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation) in a subset of patients.Results: Patients enrolled had an average duration of asthma of 34 months; the mean asthma symptom score was approximately 1.3 (scale of 0-3). All dosing regimens with BIS produced statistically significant improvement in various clinical efficacy measures for asthma control compared with placebo. The lowest dose used, 0.25 mg QD, was efficacious but with fewer efficacy parameters than seen with the other doses administered. Separation between active treatment and placebo in daytime and nighttime symptom scores were observed by week 2 of treatment for all BIS treatment regimens. A significant increase in peak flow measurement was observed in most active treatment groups compared with placebo in the subset of children able to do pulmonary function testing. All treatment groups showed numerical improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second but only the 0.5-mg BID dose was significantly different from placebo. Adverse events for the entire group and response to adrenocorticotropic hormone in a subgroup of children who underwent cortisol testing before and at the end of the treatment period were no different in budesonide-treated patients in comparison to placebo.Conclusion: Results of this study demonstrate that BIS is effective and safe for infants and young children with moderate persistent asthma in a multiple dose range, and that QD dosing is an important option to be considered by the prescribing physician.",1,1,,,,2
10955700,Low-dose inhaled budesonide once or twice daily for 27 months in children with mild asthma,"This study is an extended follow-up for 24 months of a 12-week trial to study the long-term clinical efficacy of low-dose inhaled budesonide (BUD) once or twice daily in children with mild asthma. A total of 122 children (mean age 9.7 years, girls/boys; 42/80) with mild asthma (FEV1 103.7% of predicted, reversibility in FEV1 3.5%, and fall in FEV1 after exercise 12.2%), not previously treated with inhaled steroids, were included in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. The children were treated with inhaled BUD 100 or 200 microg administered via Turbuhaler once daily in the morning, 100 microg twice daily, or placebo for 27 months. Exercise and methacholine challenges were performed at 3-month intervals the first year and at 6-month intervals the second year, in a total of seven visits. A significant dose-response effect favoring BUD 200 microg daily (vs 100 microg daily) was found when comparing changes in FEV1, FEF25%, and FEV50%; the fall in FEV1 after an exercise test; and the effect on blood eosinophils. Bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine decreased significantly on three visits in patients treated with BUD 200 microg daily compared to placebo. Growth rate was not significantly affected except in children aged 7-11 years at baseline after 12 months of treatment. In conclusion, 100 or 200 microg daily of inhaled BUD for 27 months is safe and effective in protecting against exercise-induced asthma and achieving nearly normal lung function. Baseline lung function was not significantly affected in this group of children with mild asthma.",1,1,,,,3
11101186,Efficacy and safety of dry powder fluticasone propionate in children with persistent asthma,"Background: Flovent Diskus is a powder formulation of the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone propionate (FP) delivered via a breath-actuated, multidose inhaler.Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of dry powder FP administered once or twice daily (200 microg per day) to children with persistent asthma.Methods: Twelve-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial with a 52-week, open-label extension. Children aged 4 to 11 were required to have pulmonary function 50% to 85% of predicted values. The population was stratified for baseline therapy (inhaled corticosteroid/cromolyn or bronchodilators only). After a 2-week placebo run-in, 242 patients received dry powder FP 200 microg each morning, dry powder FP 100 microg BID, or placebo for 12 weeks; 192 were rerandomized to the QD or BID regimen for an additional 52 weeks of open-label treatment. Primary endpoints were mean changes in FEV1 and morning PEF recorded at clinic visits.Results: Both dry powder FP regimens significantly improved FEV1, evening PEF, and asthma symptoms at the double-blind phase endpoint (P < or = .017 compared with placebo). The BID regimen also significantly improved morning PEF and nighttime awakenings due to asthma (P < or = .005). Among patients previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids/cromolyn, improvements observed with the QD and BID regimens were similar. Patients switched from BID to open-label QD treatment showed additional improvements at week 52 generally comparable to patients who received the BID regimen during both phases. Fluticasone propionate was well tolerated for up to 64 weeks with few reports of drug-related adverse events or morning plasma cortisol abnormalities.Conclusions: Once daily dosing of dry powder FP 200 microg is an effective and convenient alternative for children whose asthma is controlled with a more frequent dosing regimen of inhaled corticosteroids.",1,1,,,,3
14555594,Inhaled fluticasone propionate by Diskus in the treatment of asthma. A comparison of the efficacy of the same nomimal dose given either once or twice a da,"Study objective: In September 2000, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of Flovent Diskus (FD) [fluticasone propionate; GlaxoSmithKline; Research Triangle Park, NC], which is an orally inhaled, dry-powder corticosteroid, for the maintenance treatment of asthma at dosages of 50 to 1,000 microg administered twice-daily. Once-daily dosage regimens did not receive approval. This article will detail six clinical trials, five of which incorporated comparative once-daily and twice-daily treatment arms of the same nominal dose of FD.Design: Six 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma, including two pediatric asthma trials (patient age, 4 to 11 years) of total daily doses of fluticasone propionate (FP) of 100 or 200 microg, and four adult and adolescent studies of total daily doses of FP of 100, 200, or 500 microg.Results: Twice-daily dosing was numerically superior to once-daily dosing at the same nominal dose in all comparative studies for the primary end point, change in predose FEV(1). In five trials, the results of the once-daily dosage of FP were statistically indistinguishable from those with placebo. One trial demonstrated the superiority of FP, 500 microg once-daily, over placebo; however, the effect size was half that observed with twice-daily dosing. Once-daily FP dosing showed no advantage in safety or in patient adherence to medication.Conclusions: In the FDA review of once-daily dosing of the FD regimen, 100 or 200 microg once-daily dosing was not shown to be significantly better than placebo. FP 500 microg once-daily was found to be superior to placebo, but at about one half the effect size as the same nominal dose given bid. No advantage in patient safety or adherence was demonstrated for once-daily administration over twice-daily administration, and once-daily administration is not currently recommended.",1,1,,,,2
7983994,Is evidence for homeopathy reproducible ?,"We tested, under independent conditions, the reproducibility of evidence from two previous trials that homoeopathy differs from placebo. The test model was again homoeopathic immunotherapy. 28 patients with allergic asthma, most of them sensitive to house-dust mite, were randomly allocated to receive either oral homoeopathic immunotherapy to their principal allergen or identical placebo. The test treatments were given as a complement to their unaltered conventional care. A daily visual analogue scale of overall symptom intensity was the outcome measure. A difference in visual analogue score in favour of homoeopathic immunotherapy appeared within one week of starting treatment and persisted for up to 8 weeks (p = 0.003). There were similar trends in respiratory function and bronchial reactivity tests. A meta-analysis of all three trials strengthened the evidence that homoeopathy does more than placebo (p = 0.0004). Is the reproducibility of evidence in favour of homoeopathy proof of its activity or proof of the clinical trial's capacity to produce false-positive results?",1,,,,,4
11872551,Use of ultramolecular potencies of allergen to treat asthmatic people allergic to house dust mite: double blind randomised controlled clinical trial,"To evaluate the efficacy of homoeopathic immunotherapy on lung function and respiratory symptoms in asthmatic people allergic to house dust mite.Double blind randomised controlled trial.38 general practices in Hampshire and Dorset.242 people with asthma and positive results to skin prick test for house dust mite; 202 completed clinic based assessments, and 186 completed diary based assessments.After a four week baseline assessment, participants were randomised to receive oral homoeopathic immunotherapy or placebo and then assessed over 16 weeks with three clinic visits and diary assessments every other week.Clinic based assessments: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life, and mood. Diary based assessments: morning and evening peak expiratory flow, visual analogue scale of severity of asthma, quality of life, and daily mood.There was no difference in most outcomes between placebo and homoeopathic immunotherapy. There was a different pattern of change over the trial for three of the diary assessments: morning peak expiratory flow (P=0.025), visual analogue scale (P=0.017), and mood (P=0.035). At week three there was significant deterioration for visual analogue scale (P=0.047) and mood (P=0.013) in the homoeopathic immunotherapy group compared with the placebo group. Any improvement in participants' asthma was independent of belief in complementary medicine.Homoeopathic immunotherapy is not effective in the treatment of patients with asthma. The different patterns of change between homoeopathic immunotherapy and placebo over the course of the study are unexplained.Homoeopathic remedies probably have an effect that is greater than placeboSome of the better quality homoeopathic studies involve homoeopathic doses of allergens used to treat allergic diseaseIn this study homoeopathic remedies were no better than placebo in the treatment of asthmatic patients who are allergic to house dust mite",1,,,,,2
