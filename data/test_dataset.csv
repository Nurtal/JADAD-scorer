8423275,Treatment of allergic rhinitis with intranasal corticosteroids in patients with mild asthma: effect on lower airway responsiveness,"The effect of treatment of allergic rhinitis with intranasal corticosteroids on lower airway responsiveness was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Twenty-one young patients with perennial allergic rhinitis and asthma, with documented lower airway hyperresponsiveness (PC20 methacholine < 8 mg/ml), were treated with intranasal aqueous beclomethasone dipropionate and placebo, each given for 4 weeks. Patients recorded rhinitis and asthma symptom scores and monitored peak expiratory flow rates every morning and evening. Patients recorded global assessment of rhinitis and global asthma symptom scores at the beginning and end of each treatment. PC20 methacholine was performed at baseline and at the end of each treatment period. Intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate significantly reduced global rhinitis symptom scores (p = 0.05) after 4 weeks of treatment. Global asthma scores did not change significantly (p = 0.2). Geometric mean PC20 methacholine improved significantly after 4 weeks of intranasal beclomethasone, but not after placebo (p = 0.04). Daily morning and evening rhinitis symptom scores were lower in patients treated with intranasal corticosteroids over the first 4 weeks of treatment, but carryover effect of steroids precluded comparative analysis of the second 4-week block (morning p = 0.06, evening p = 0.03). Morning asthma scores tended to decrease (p = 0.07). Evening asthma scores were significantly decreased at weeks 2 and 3 (p = 0.001, p = 0.02, respectively). No change in peak expiratory flow rate was seen. This study confirms that treatment of inflammation in the upper airways indirectly improves asthma symptoms and decreases bronchial hyperreactivity. Ignoring inflammation in the upper airway may lead to suboptimal results in asthma treatment.",1,1,1,0,0,3
9864004,Clinical efficacy of low-dose inhaled budesonide once or twice daily in children with mild asthma not previously treated with steroids,"The aim of the present study was to examine the efficacy of low-dose inhaled budesonide (BUD) administered via Turbuhaler once or twice daily on symptoms, lung function and bronchial hyperreactivity in children with mild asthma. One hundred and sixty-three children (mean age 9.9 yrs, 56 females/107 males) with mild asthma (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 103% of predicted, morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) 87% pred, reversibility in FEV1 3%, fall in FEV1 after exercise 10.4% from pre-exercise value) and not previously treated with inhaled steroids, were included in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. After a two-week run-in period, the children received inhaled BUD 100 microg or 200 microg once daily in the morning, 100 microg twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks. Exercise and methacholine challenges were performed before and at the end of treatment. After 12 weeks of therapy, the fall in FEV1 after an exercise test was significantly less in all three BUD groups (43-5.1%) than in the placebo group (8.6%). Bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine with the provocative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 decreased significantly in the BUD 100 microg twice-daily group compared with placebo (ratio at the end of treatment 156%). Changes in baseline lung function (FEV1 and PEF) were less marked than changes in bronchial responsiveness. In conclusion, low doses of inhaled budesonide, given once or twice daily, provided protection against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in children with mild asthma and near normal lung function.",1,1,1,0,0,3
10536064,Efficacy of once-daily versus twice-daily administration of budesonide by turbuhaler in children with stable asthma,"We evaluated the efficacy of once-daily versus twice-daily treatment with budesonide, delivered by a Turbuhaler(R), in the management of children with stable asthma in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study involving 206 children (age 5-15 years). After a 2-week run-in period during which the children were maintained on their usual dose of budesonide (200 microg or 400 microg/day), patients were randomized to receive the same daily dose in either two daily administrations (morning and evening) or as a single dose in the morning over a period of 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). The mean morning PEF during the run-in phase was 271 L/min in patients randomized to once-daily treatment and 264 L/min in those randomized to twice-daily treatment. The mean change from baseline to the last 2 weeks of the treatment period in the two groups was -0.3 L/min (95% confidence limits -6.6 to +6.0) and 2.5 L/min (-4.3 to +9.3). The estimated difference between the groups was -2.8 L/min, with 90% confidence limits of -10.4 + 4.5; these were close to the limits regarded as indicative of equivalence (-10 to +10), and hence the difference was not regarded as clinically relevant. Similarly, there were no significant differences between the groups in regard to secondary efficacy measures such as spirometric tests and symptom scores. Both treatments were well tolerated. We conclude that once-daily administration of budesonide by Turbuhaler(R) is as effective as twice-daily treatment in the management of stable asthma in children treated with inhaled steroids at doses of 200-400 microg/day.",1,1,1,0,0,3
9925834,"A multiple–dosing, placebo–controlled study of budesonide inhalation suspension given once or twice daily for treatment of persistent asthma in young children and infants","Rationale: Topical antiinflammatory medications such as inhaled corticosteroids are recommended for therapy of asthma, but no formulation suitable for administration to infants and young children is available in the United States.Methods: This was a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study comparing the efficacy and safety of four dosing regimens of bude-sonide inhalation suspension (BIS) or placebo in 480 asthmatic infants and children (64% boys), ages 6 months to 8 years, with moderate persistent asthma. Approximately 30% of children were previously on inhaled corticosteroids that were discontinued before the study. Active treatments were comprised of BIS 0.25 mg once daily (QD), 0.25 mg twice a day (BID), 0.5 mg BID, or 1.0 mg QD. Efficacy was assessed by twice daily recording at home of asthma symptom scores and use of rescue medication, and discontinuation from the study because of worsening asthma and/or a requirement for systemic steroids. Peak flow measurements were recorded twice daily on diary and spirometry was recorded at clinic visits for those children able to perform these tests. Safety was assessed by reported adverse events and by cortisol testing (adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation) in a subset of patients.Results: Patients enrolled had an average duration of asthma of 34 months; the mean asthma symptom score was approximately 1.3 (scale of 0-3). All dosing regimens with BIS produced statistically significant improvement in various clinical efficacy measures for asthma control compared with placebo. The lowest dose used, 0.25 mg QD, was efficacious but with fewer efficacy parameters than seen with the other doses administered. Separation between active treatment and placebo in daytime and nighttime symptom scores were observed by week 2 of treatment for all BIS treatment regimens. A significant increase in peak flow measurement was observed in most active treatment groups compared with placebo in the subset of children able to do pulmonary function testing. All treatment groups showed numerical improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second but only the 0.5-mg BID dose was significantly different from placebo. Adverse events for the entire group and response to adrenocorticotropic hormone in a subgroup of children who underwent cortisol testing before and at the end of the treatment period were no different in budesonide-treated patients in comparison to placebo.Conclusion: Results of this study demonstrate that BIS is effective and safe for infants and young children with moderate persistent asthma in a multiple dose range, and that QD dosing is an important option to be considered by the prescribing physician.",1,1,1,0,-1,2
10955700,Low-dose inhaled budesonide once or twice daily for 27 months in children with mild asthma,"This study is an extended follow-up for 24 months of a 12-week trial to study the long-term clinical efficacy of low-dose inhaled budesonide (BUD) once or twice daily in children with mild asthma. A total of 122 children (mean age 9.7 years, girls/boys; 42/80) with mild asthma (FEV1 103.7% of predicted, reversibility in FEV1 3.5%, and fall in FEV1 after exercise 12.2%), not previously treated with inhaled steroids, were included in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. The children were treated with inhaled BUD 100 or 200 microg administered via Turbuhaler once daily in the morning, 100 microg twice daily, or placebo for 27 months. Exercise and methacholine challenges were performed at 3-month intervals the first year and at 6-month intervals the second year, in a total of seven visits. A significant dose-response effect favoring BUD 200 microg daily (vs 100 microg daily) was found when comparing changes in FEV1, FEF25%, and FEV50%; the fall in FEV1 after an exercise test; and the effect on blood eosinophils. Bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine decreased significantly on three visits in patients treated with BUD 200 microg daily compared to placebo. Growth rate was not significantly affected except in children aged 7-11 years at baseline after 12 months of treatment. In conclusion, 100 or 200 microg daily of inhaled BUD for 27 months is safe and effective in protecting against exercise-induced asthma and achieving nearly normal lung function. Baseline lung function was not significantly affected in this group of children with mild asthma.",1,1,0,1,0,3
11101186,Efficacy and safety of dry powder fluticasone propionate in children with persistent asthma,"Background: Flovent Diskus is a powder formulation of the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone propionate (FP) delivered via a breath-actuated, multidose inhaler.Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of dry powder FP administered once or twice daily (200 microg per day) to children with persistent asthma.Methods: Twelve-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial with a 52-week, open-label extension. Children aged 4 to 11 were required to have pulmonary function 50% to 85% of predicted values. The population was stratified for baseline therapy (inhaled corticosteroid/cromolyn or bronchodilators only). After a 2-week placebo run-in, 242 patients received dry powder FP 200 microg each morning, dry powder FP 100 microg BID, or placebo for 12 weeks; 192 were rerandomized to the QD or BID regimen for an additional 52 weeks of open-label treatment. Primary endpoints were mean changes in FEV1 and morning PEF recorded at clinic visits.Results: Both dry powder FP regimens significantly improved FEV1, evening PEF, and asthma symptoms at the double-blind phase endpoint (P < or = .017 compared with placebo). The BID regimen also significantly improved morning PEF and nighttime awakenings due to asthma (P < or = .005). Among patients previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids/cromolyn, improvements observed with the QD and BID regimens were similar. Patients switched from BID to open-label QD treatment showed additional improvements at week 52 generally comparable to patients who received the BID regimen during both phases. Fluticasone propionate was well tolerated for up to 64 weeks with few reports of drug-related adverse events or morning plasma cortisol abnormalities.Conclusions: Once daily dosing of dry powder FP 200 microg is an effective and convenient alternative for children whose asthma is controlled with a more frequent dosing regimen of inhaled corticosteroids.",1,1,1,0,0,3
7983994,Is evidence for homeopathy reproducible ?,"We tested, under independent conditions, the reproducibility of evidence from two previous trials that homoeopathy differs from placebo. The test model was again homoeopathic immunotherapy. 28 patients with allergic asthma, most of them sensitive to house-dust mite, were randomly allocated to receive either oral homoeopathic immunotherapy to their principal allergen or identical placebo. The test treatments were given as a complement to their unaltered conventional care. A daily visual analogue scale of overall symptom intensity was the outcome measure. A difference in visual analogue score in favour of homoeopathic immunotherapy appeared within one week of starting treatment and persisted for up to 8 weeks (p = 0.003). There were similar trends in respiratory function and bronchial reactivity tests. A meta-analysis of all three trials strengthened the evidence that homoeopathy does more than placebo (p = 0.0004). Is the reproducibility of evidence in favour of homoeopathy proof of its activity or proof of the clinical trial's capacity to produce false-positive results?",1,1,1,1,-1,4
11872551,Use of ultramolecular potencies of allergen to treat asthmatic people allergic to house dust mite: double blind randomised controlled clinical trial,"To evaluate the efficacy of homoeopathic immunotherapy on lung function and respiratory symptoms in asthmatic people allergic to house dust mite.Double blind randomised controlled trial.38 general practices in Hampshire and Dorset.242 people with asthma and positive results to skin prick test for house dust mite; 202 completed clinic based assessments, and 186 completed diary based assessments.After a four week baseline assessment, participants were randomised to receive oral homoeopathic immunotherapy or placebo and then assessed over 16 weeks with three clinic visits and diary assessments every other week.Clinic based assessments: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life, and mood. Diary based assessments: morning and evening peak expiratory flow, visual analogue scale of severity of asthma, quality of life, and daily mood.There was no difference in most outcomes between placebo and homoeopathic immunotherapy. There was a different pattern of change over the trial for three of the diary assessments: morning peak expiratory flow (P=0.025), visual analogue scale (P=0.017), and mood (P=0.035). At week three there was significant deterioration for visual analogue scale (P=0.047) and mood (P=0.013) in the homoeopathic immunotherapy group compared with the placebo group. Any improvement in participants' asthma was independent of belief in complementary medicine.Homoeopathic immunotherapy is not effective in the treatment of patients with asthma. The different patterns of change between homoeopathic immunotherapy and placebo over the course of the study are unexplained.Homoeopathic remedies probably have an effect that is greater than placeboSome of the better quality homoeopathic studies involve homoeopathic doses of allergens used to treat allergic diseaseIn this study homoeopathic remedies were no better than placebo in the treatment of asthmatic patients who are allergic to house dust mite",1,1,1,1,1,5
12668794,Individualised homeopathy as an adjunct in the treatment of childhood asthma: a randomised placebo controlled trial,"Background: Homeopathy is frequently used to treat asthma in children. In the common classical form of homeopathy, prescriptions are individualised for each patient. There has been no rigorous investigation into this form of treatment for asthma.Methods: In a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial the effects of individualised homeopathic remedies were compared with placebo medication in 96 children with mild to moderate asthma as an adjunct to conventional treatment. The main outcome measure was the active quality of living subscale of the Childhood Asthma Questionnaire administered at baseline and follow up at 12 months. Other outcome measures included other subscales of the same questionnaire, peak flow rates, use of medication, symptom scores, days off school, asthma events, global assessment of change, and adverse reactions.Results: There were no clinically relevant or statistically significant changes in the active quality of life score. Other subscales, notably those measuring severity, indicated relative improvements but the sizes of the effects were small. There were no differences between the groups for other measures.Conclusions: This study provides no evidence that adjunctive homeopathic remedies, as prescribed by experienced homeopathic practitioners, are superior to placebo in improving the quality of life of children with mild to moderate asthma in addition to conventional treatment in primary care.",1,1,1,1,1,5

12038884,Comparison of 2 iron doses in infants receiving recombinant human erythropoietin therapy,"Objective: To compare iron sufficiency in premature infants receiving high-dose recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO), 1200 IU/kg per week, supplemented with 6 or 12 mg/kg per day of enteral iron.Design: We conducted a prospective, double-blind, controlled study of premature infants receiving r-HuEPO therapy, randomly assigned to receive 2 different doses of iron. Measurements of ferritin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, reticulocyte count, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit were obtained at baseline, 4, and 6 weeks. Transferrin saturation was calculated; the number of blood transfusions and the incidences of sepsis were recorded.Setting: This study was performed in the neonatal intensive care unit at Loma Linda University Children's Hospital, Loma Linda, Calif.Subjects: Infants with a gestational age of 32 weeks or younger, older than 7 days, and receiving r-HuEPO therapy from March 1, 1997, to June 30, 1998, were eligible for the study. Infants were randomly assigned to receive 6 mg/kg per day or 12 mg/kg per day of enteral iron during a course of r-HuEPO therapy for 4 to 6 weeks.Results: Sixty-four infants were enrolled in the study. Twelve infants did not complete the study; 52 completed 4 weeks and 41 completed 6 weeks of the study. While ferritin levels and transferrin saturation decreased in both groups over the study period, there were no differences between the 2 study groups.Conclusions: Infants receiving high-dose r-HuEPO therapy (1200 IU/kg per week) decrease their ferritin levels (measure of iron stores) even when receiving high enteral iron supplementation. Given that the ferritin levels were similar between the 2 groups, we speculate that the additional iron either was not absorbed or was not stored.",1,1,1,1,1,5
17305661,"Comparison between single-dose oral prednisolone and oral dexamethasone in the treatment of croup: a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial","Objective: To compare the effectiveness of three corticosteroid regimens in children with mild to moderate croup.Methods: Double-blinded, randomized comparative trial with parallel design, conducted in the ED of a paediatric tertiary care hospital. Children aged 6 months to 6 years presenting to the ED with croup were eligible for inclusion if their Westley croup score was 2 or more. They were randomized to receive a single oral dose of either prednisolone 1 mg/kg, dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg. Primary outcome measures were the magnitude and rate of reduction in Westley croup score, rate of return for medical care with ongoing croup, and further treatment with steroids in the week following index presentation. Secondary outcome measures were the proportion of subjects requiring admission or salvage therapy, such as nebulized adrenaline, during index presentation.Results: A total of 99 children, aged 6-79 months, were enrolled (mean age: 1.7 years). Thirty-four patients were randomized to receive prednisolone 1 mg/kg, 34 to receive dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg, and 31 to receive dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were similar. The parents of 86 patients (87%) were available for follow-up telephone interview at 1 week. There were no significant differences in primary or secondary outcome measures between the three treatment groups.Conclusions: Both prednisolone 1 mg/kg and low-dose dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) were found not to differ in efficacy from the currently recommended 0.6 mg/kg dexamethasone. The use of these corticosteroid regimens in treating patients with mild to moderate croup is thus supported.",1,1,1,1,1,5
17208307,A randomized comparison of dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg versus 0.6 mg/kg for the treatment of moderate to severe croup,"Background: Although previous studies have shown that dexamethasone is useful in croup, the optimal dosage has not been clarified yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg single dose compared with the recommended dose of 0.6 mg/kg for treatment of hospitalized children with moderate to severe croup.Method: Forty-one children aged 6 months to 5 years admitted from March 2001 to October 2003 at the pediatric ward of Hatyai Hospital with moderate to severe croup were recruited for the study. After random allocation, each child received a single intravenous injection of either dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg (maximum dose 12 mg) or 0.15 mg/kg (maximum dose 3 mg). All children were given a single dose of epinephrine nebulization at the beginning of the study. The croup scores were measured at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h after the dexamethasone injection.Results: One hour following the injection, the mean croup scores were significantly reduced from baseline values in both groups (p<0.01). There was no difference in the mean croup scores between the two groups at any time. Median times to croup scores equal or less than two in both high- and low-dose groups were 8 and 7.9 h, respectively. No patient required intubation or was removed from the study because of a rising croup score after enrollment. There was no significant adverse reaction from dexamethasone treatment in either group.Conclusion: Dexamethasone 0.15 and 0.6 mg/kg are equally effective in the treatment of moderate to severe croup.",1,1,1,1,1,5
9797624,Iron supplementation enhances response to high doses of recombinant human erythropoietin in preterm infants,"AIMS—To determine whether iron supplementation would enhance erythropoiesis in preterm infants treated with high doses of human recombinant erythropoietin (r-HuEPO).METHODS—Sixty three preterm infants were randomly allocated at birth to one of three groups to receive: r-HuEPO alone, 1200 IU/kg/week (EPO); or r-HuEPO and iron, 1200 IU/kg/week of r-HuEPO plus 20mg/kg/week of intravenous iron (EPO+iron); or to serve as controls. All three groups received blood transfusions according to uniform guidelines.RESULTS—Infants in the EPO+iron group needed fewer transfusions than controls—mean (95% CI) 1.0 (0.28-1.18) vs 2.9 (1.84-3.88) and received lower volumes of blood—mean (95% CI) 16.7 (4.9-28.6) vs 44.4 (29.0-59.7) ml/kg. The EPO group also needed lower volumes of blood than the controls—mean (95% CI) 20.1 (6.2-34.2) vs 44.4(29.0-59.7) ml/kg, but the same number of transfusions, 1.3 (0.54-2.06) vs 2.9 (1.84-3.88). Reticulocyte and haematocrit values from postnatal weeks 5 to 8 were higher in the EPO+iron than in the EPO group, and both groups had higher values than the controls. Mean (SEM) plasma ferritin was lower in the EPO group—65 (55) µg/l than in the EPO+iron group 780 (182) µg/l, and 561 (228) µg/l in the control infants.CONCLUSIONS—Early administration of high doses of r-HuEPO with iron supplements significantly reduced the need for blood transfusion. Intravenous iron (20 mg/kg/week in conjunction with r-HuEPO yielded a higher reticulocyte count and haematocrit concentration after the forth week of life than r-HuEPO alone. Infants treated with r-HuEPO alone showed signs of reduced iron stores.",1,1,1,0,0,3
10048613,Oral iron is sufficient for erythropoietin treatment of very low birth-weight infant,"The aim of this study was to compare two different doses and means of administration of iron in recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO)-treated very low birth-weight (VLBW) infants. VLBW infants (n = 41) were randomized to one of three groups. Fourteen infants were treated with rHuEPO (300 IU/kg three times a week s.c.) and oral iron (ferrofumarate, 6 mg of iron/kg per day). Another 14 infants received the same erythropoietin dose and intramuscular iron (ferroxypolymaltose, once 12 mg of iron/kg weekly). Thirteen infants were treated with the same dose of intramuscular iron but did not receive rHuEPO. After the 3-week study period, haemoglobin concentrations and reticulocyte counts were similar in the rHuEPO-treated groups and both were higher than in the group not receiving rHuEPO (P < 0.001). In both rHuEPO-treated groups the transferrin receptor concentration increased from 6.8-7.2 mg/l to 10.5-11.3 mg/l.Conclusion: In erythropoietin-treated very low birth weight infants the iron need for erythropoiesis can be met by oral administration of iron.",1,0,1,0,0,2
8765624,A comparison of oral and intravenous iron supplementation in preterm infants receiving recombinant erythropoietin,"Objective: To determine whether intravenously administered iron supplements would improve the hematologic response to recombinant erythropoietin in stable preterm infants.Methods: Forty-two preterm infants (<33 weeks' gestation, birth weight < 1500 gm, hematocrit <38%) were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (Eprex), 600 U/kg per week, and randomly assigned to receive either an oral preparation of ferrous lactate (elemental iron, 12 mg/kg per day) or an intravenous preparation of iron sucrose (6 mg/kg per week).Results: Hematocrits, reticulocyte counts, and transfusions were similar in the oral group (OG) and the intravenous group (IVG). However, markedly higher serum ferritin concentrations were noted in the IVG (p <0.001), and by completion of the study the arithmetic mean values were 265 +/- 127 microg/L versus 137 +/- 65 microg/L in the IVG and the OG, respectively. The numbers of hypochromic erythrocytes increased in both groups during the study but were significantly higher in the OG (p = 0.04). Mean daily weight gain in the IVG (27 +/- 6.4 gm/day) was greater than in the OG (22.9 +/- 4.78 gm/day; p = 0.04).Conclusions: High doses of both orally administered iron and intravenously administered iron sucrose appear to supply sufficient iron for erythropoiesis in stable infants. Storage iron may become depleted after oral supplementation. The intravenous preparation appears to be safe and maintains serum ferritin concentrations, and it may be indicated for patients with low ferritin levels and for those not established on enteral feedings.",1,0,1,0,0,2
11533837,The Role if High-Dose Oral Iron Supplementation During Erythropoietin Therapy for Anemia of Prematurity,"Objective: To assess whether a high intake of oral iron would increase the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on hemoglobin synthesis.Methods: We studied 30 preterm infants (gestational age 29+/-1.8 weeks, birth weight 1161+/-200 g, at age of 28+/-10 days) who were randomly assigned to receive either 8 mg/kg per day (n=15) or 16 mg/kg per day of oral iron during a course of rHuEPO therapy (900 microg/kg per week) for a duration of 4 weeks. Both groups were comparable in regard to clinical and laboratory data at the time of enrollment.Results: rHuEPO caused a significant increase in reticulocyte count in the low- and high-dose iron groups, 17.1+/-5.3 to 34.7+/-9.2 and 16.3+/-3.3 to 42.5+/-5.6 (10(9)/l), respectively (p<0.05). However, in both groups, hematocrit values remained stable at the end of the study as compared to baseline (0.35+/-0.03% vs. 0.30+/-0.03%, 0.35+/-0.05% vs. 0.30+/-0.03%, NS) and in both groups there was a comparable and significant decrease in ferritin level (259+/-109 to 101+/-40 and 168+/-54 to 69+/-38 microg/l, respectively; p<0.01). The rates of bloody stools without any evidence of necrotizing enterocolitis were not significantly different between the two treatment groups (1/15 vs. 4/15, NS).Conclusion: We conclude that a higher dose (16 mg/kg per day) of oral iron is not more beneficial when compared to a lower dose (8 mg/kg per day) during rHuEPO therapy for anemia of prematurity. Further studies will define the optimal dosage and route of administration of iron supplementation during rHuEPO therapy",1,0,1,0,0,2
12014386,Safety and efficacy of ibuprofen versus indomethacin in preterm infants treated for patent ductus arteriosus: a randomised controlled trial,"Indomethacin (INDO) and, more recently, ibuprofen (IBU) have been used to treat haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants. Both are cyclo-oxygenase blockers, but seem to have a different influence on regional circulation. In a prospective, randomised, controlled study, we compared INDO and IBU with regard to efficacy and safety for the early non-invasive treatment of PDA. Doppler echocardiography was used to study 232 preterm infants (gestational age 23-34 weeks) with respiratory distress syndrome of whom 175 had persistent, haemodynamically significant PDA at 48-72 h of life. They were randomised to receive three intravenous doses of either INDO (0.2 mg/kg, at 12 h intervals) or IBU (a first 10 mg/kg dose followed by two doses of 5 mg/kg at 24 h intervals), recording rate of ductal closure, need for additional treatment, side-effects and clinical course. The efficacy of the pharmacological treatment was similar in the two groups (56/81, 69% INDO; 69/94, 73% IBU). Patients treated with INDO showed a significant increase in serum creatinine (89 +/- 24 versus 82 +/- 20 mmol/l, P = 0.03) and a near-significant tendency for a lower fractional excretion of sodium (3 +/- 3 versus 4 +/- 2%, P = 0.08); moreover, 12/81 (15%) INDO patients versus 1/94 (1%) IBU patients became oliguric (< 1 ml/kg per h) during treatment (P = 0.017).Conclusion: Our findings confirm that, by comparison with indomethacin, ibuprofen has fewer effects on renal function in terms of urine output and fluid retention, with much the same efficacy and safety in closing patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. In particular, no increased incidence of intracranial haemorrhage was observed after ibuprofen treatment.",1,0,1,0,0,2
10974130,A comparison of ibuprofen and indomethacin for closure of patent ductus arteriosus.,"Background: Indomethacin is the conventional treatment for hemodynamically important patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants. However, its use is associated with various side effects. In a prospective study, we compared ibuprofen and indomethacin with regard to efficacy and safety for the early treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants.Methods: We studied 148 infants (gestational age, 24 to 32 weeks) who had the respiratory distress syndrome and an echocardiographically confirmed, hemodynamically important patent ductus arteriosus. The infants were randomly assigned at five neonatal intensive care centers to receive three intravenous doses of either indomethacin (0.2 mg per kilogram of body weight, given at 12-hour intervals) or ibuprofen (a first dose of 10 mg per kilogram, followed at 24-hour intervals by two doses of 5 mq per kilogram each), starting on the third day of life. The rate of ductal closure, the need for additional treatment, side effects, complications, and the infants' clinical course were recorded.Results: The rate of ductal closure was similar with the two treatments: ductal closure occurred in 49 of 74 infants given indomethacin (66 percent), and in 52 of 74 given ibuprofen (70 percent) (relative risk, 0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.17; P=0.41). The numbers of infants who needed a second pharmacologic treatment or surgical ductal ligation did not differ significantly between the two groups. Oliguria occurred in 5 infants treated with ibuprofen and in 14 treated with indomethacin (P=0.03). There were no significant differences with respect to other side effects or complications.Conclusions: Ibuprofen therapy on the third day of life is as efficacious as indomethacin for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants with the respiratory distress syndrome and is significantly less likely to induce oliguria.",1,0,0,1,0,2
9175948,Treatment of patent ductus arteriosus with ibuprofen,"AIM—To evaluate the efficiency and side effects of ibuprofen for the early treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)and compare it with indomethacin.METHODS—Forty preterm infants with gestational ages of less than 33 weeks, with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and echocardiographically confirmed PDA, were randomly assigned at days 2 to 3 of life to receive either intravenous indomethacin 3 × 0.2 mg/kg at 12 hour intervals or intravenous ibuprofen 1 × 10 mg/kg, followed by 5 mg/kg 24 and 48 hours later.RESULTS—PDA closed in 15 of 20 patients from the indomethacin group (75%) and in 16 of 20 (80%) from the ibuprofen group. Seven patients (three indomethacin, four ibuprofen) required a second treatment with indomethacin and in five (three in the indomethacin group and two in the ibuprofen group) the duct was ultimately ligated. Ibuprofen patients had a better urinary output and showed no increase in serum creatinine concentrations compared with the indomethacin group. Ibuprofen was not associated with any other side effect.CONCLUSIONS—Ibuprofen treatment seems to be as efficient as indomethacin in closing PDA on the third day of life in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome and seems to have fewer renal side effects.",1,0,1,0,0,2
12627000, Helium-oxygen versus air-oxygen noninvasive pressure support in decompensated chronic obstructive disease: A prospective multi-center study.,"Objective: To study whether noninvasive pressure support ventilation (NIPSV) with helium/oxygen (He/oxygen), which can reduce dyspnea, PaCO2, and work of breathing more than NIPSV with air/oxygen in decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, could have beneficial consequences on outcome and hospitalization costs.Design: Prospective, randomized, multicenter study.Setting: Intensive care units of three tertiary care university hospitals.Patients: All patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admitted to the intensive care units for NIPSV during a 24-month period.Interventions: Patients were randomized to NIPSV with air/oxygen or He/oxygen. NIPSV settings, number of daily trials, decision to intubate, and intensive care unit and hospital discharge criteria followed standard practice guidelines.Results: A total of 123 patients (male/female ratio, 71:52; age, 71 +/- 10 yrs, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, 17 +/- 4) were included. Intubation rate (air/oxygen 20% vs. He/oxygen 13%) and length of stay in the intensive care unit (air/oxygen 6.2 +/- 5.6 vs. He/oxygen 5.1 +/- 4 days) were comparable. The post-intensive care unit hospital stay was lower with He/oxygen (air/oxygen 19 +/- 12 vs. He/oxygen 13 +/- 6 days, p < .002). Cost of NIPSV gases was higher with He/oxygen, but total hospitalization costs were lower by $3,348 per patient with He/oxygen. No complications were associated with the use of He/oxygen.Conclusion: He/oxygen did not significantly reduce intubation rate or intensive care unit stay, but hospital stay was shorter and total costs were lower. He/oxygen NIPSV can be safely administered and could prove to be a cost-effective strategy.",1,0,1,0,0,2
12771612,Helium/oxygen mixture reduces the work of breathing at the end of the weaning process in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary diseas,"Objective: To test the hypothesis that helium/oxygen mixture can reduce the work of breathing at the end of the weaning process in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Design: Prospective, randomized, crossover study.Setting: Two medical intensive care units at two university tertiary care centers.Patients: Thirteen patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease evaluated just before and after extubation.Interventions: Helium/oxygen and air/oxygen mixtures were administered sequentially, for 20 mins each, in a randomized order, just before extubation. It was possible to repeat the study after extubation in five patients.Measurements and main results: Before extubation, the helium/oxygen mixture induced no significant variation in the breathing pattern. By contrast, it reduced the work of breathing from 1.442 +/- 0.718 J/L (mean +/- sd) to 1.133 +/- 0.500 J/L (p <.05). This reduction was explained mainly by a reduction in the resistive component of the work of breathing from 0.662 +/- 0.376 to 0.459 +/- 0.256 J/L (p <.01). We also observed a slight reduction in the intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure from 2.9 +/- 2.1 cm H(2)O to 2.1 +/- 1.8 cm H(2)O (p <.05). Similar results were also observed after extubation in five patients in whom the repetition of the study was possible.Conclusions: In spontaneously breathing intubated patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease recovering from an acute exacerbation, helium/oxygen mixture reduces the work of breathing as well as intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure without modifying the breathing pattern.",1,0,1,-1,0,1
10764311,Noninvasive ventilation with Helium-oxygen in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"The use of helium-oxygen (HeO(2)) was tested in combination with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in 10 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Effort to breathe as assessed by the respiratory muscle pressure-time index (PTI), work of breathing (WOB), and gas exchange were the main endpoints. Results of NIV-HeO(2) were compared with those obtained with standard NIV (AirO(2)), at two levels of pressure-support ventilation (PSV), 9 +/- 2 cm H(2)O and 18 +/- 3 cm H(2)O. Significant reductions in PTI were observed between HeO(2) and AirO(2) at both the low PSV level (n = 9; 160 +/- 58 versus 198 +/- 78 cm H(2)O/s/ min; p < 0.05) and the high PSV level (n = 10; 100 +/- 45 versus 150 +/- 82 cm H(2)O/s/min; p < 0.01). WOB also differed significantly between HeO(2) and AirO(2) (7.8 +/- 4.1 versus 10.9 +/- 6.1 J/min at the low PSV level, p < 0.05; and 5.7 +/- 3.3 versus 9.2 +/- 5. J/min, p < 0.01 at the high PSV level). HeO(2) reduced Pa(CO(2)) at both the low PSV level (61 +/- 13 versus 64 +/- 15 mm Hg; p < 0.05) and the high PSV level (56 +/- 13 versus 58 +/- 14 mm Hg; p < 0.05), without significantly changing breathing pattern or oxygenation. We conclude that use of HeO(2) during NIV markedly enhances the ability of NIV to reduce patient effort and to improve gas exchange.",1,0,1,0,0,2
11008978,Randomized trial of the use of heliox as a driving gas for updraft nebulization of bronchodilators in the emergent treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Objective: To determine whether the bronchodilator effects of albuterol and ipratropium bromide are greater if updraft nebulization is driven by 80% helium and 20% oxygen (HELIOX) than if driven by compressed room air (AIR) during the treatment of an acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Setting: The emergency department of a 750-bed inner-city community hospital.Methods: Over a 12-month period, a convenience sample of 50 normoxic patients presenting with signs and symptoms of an acute exacerbation of COPD were prospectively randomized to receive either HELIOX or AIR as the driving gas for updraft nebulization of a mixture of albuterol 2.5 mg and ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg. Additional aerosol treatments with albuterol 2.5 mg were given at 20, 40, and 120 mins after randomization using the assigned gas. Spirometry was obtained while breathing room air before the first treatment (baseline) and at 1 hr and 2 hrs after the initiation of treatment. The primary measure of efficacy was the change in percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) over the treatment period. A secondary measure of efficacy was the change in percentage of predicted forced expiratory flow after 25% to 75% of vital capacity had been expelled (FEF25-75).Results: Twenty-five patients were randomized to each treatment group. Three patients (1 HELIOX, 2 AIR) were unable to complete the study. The baseline FEV1was 44% (95% confidence interval, 35% to 52%) of predicted in the HELIOX group and 39 (31% to 46%) of predicted in the AIR group. There were no adverse outcomes observed in either the HELIOX group or the AIR group. There were no significant differences in the change of FEV1 between the two groups by either the 1 hr or 2 hr time point (1 hr, HELIOX + 10% [7% to 13%], AIR + 9% [5% to 13%]; 2 hr HELIOX + 10% [6% to 15%], AIR + 10% [6% to 14%]). The improvement in FEF25-75 was significantly greater in the HELIOX group than in the AIR group at both the 1 hr time point (HELIOX + 14% [7% to 22%] vs. AIR + 7% [3% to 10%], p = .05) and at the 2 hr time point (HELIOX + 15% [8% to 21%] vs. AIR + 7% [4% to 11%], p = .05).Conclusion: Use of HELIOX as a driving gas for the updraft nebulization of bronchodilators during the first 2 hrs of treatment of an acute COPD exacerbation failed to improve FEV1 faster than the use of AIR. The faster improvement in FEF25-75 during the first 2 hrs of treatment was small and of uncertain clinical significance.",1,0,1,1,-1,2
10966241,Effects of Helium-oxygen on intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Objective: To test the hypothesis that replacing 70:30 nitrogen: oxygen (Air-O2) with 70:30 helium:oxygen (He-O2) can decrease dynamic hyperinflation (""intrinsic"" positive end-expiratory pressure) in mechanically ventilated patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to document the consequences of such an effect on arterial blood gases and hemodynamics.Design: Prospective, interventional study.Setting: Medical intensive care unit, university tertiary care center.Patients: Twenty-three intubated, sedated, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated patients with COPD enrolled within 36 hrs after intubation.Interventions: Measurements were taken at the following time points, all with the same ventilator settings: a) baseline; b) after 45 mins with He-O2; c) 45 mins after return to Air-O2. The results were then compared to those obtained in a test lung model using the same ventilator settings. MAIN RESULTS (MEAN + SD): Trapped lung volume and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure decreased during He-O2 ventilation (215+/-125 mL vs. 99+/-15 mL and 9+/-2.5 cm H2O vs. 5+/-2.7 cm H2O, respectively; p < .05). Likewise, peak and mean airway pressures declined with He-O2 (30+/-5 cm H2O vs. 25+/-6 cm H2O and 8+/-2 cm H2O vs. 7+/-2 cm H2O, respectively; p < .05). These parameters all rose to their baseline values on return to Air-O2 (p < .05 vs. values during He-O2). These results were in accordance with those obtained in the test lung model. There was no modification of arterial blood gases, heart rate, or mean systemic arterial blood pressure. In 12/23 patients, a pulmonary artery catheter was in place, allowing hemodynamic measurements and venous admixture calculations. Switching to He-O2 and back to Air-O2 had no effect on pulmonary artery pressures, right and left ventricular filling pressures, cardiac output, pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance, or venous admixture.Conclusion: In mechanically ventilated COPD patients with intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, the use of He-O2 can markedly reduce trapped lung volume, intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, and peak and mean airway pressures. No effect was noted on hemodynamics or arterial blood gases. He-O2 might prove beneficial in this setting to reduce the risk of barotrauma, as well as to improve hemodynamics and gas exchange in patients with very high levels of intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure.",0,0,1,0,0,1
3996069,Helium-oxygen breathing in severe COPD,"The effect of breathing helium-oxygen (He-O2) mixtures was evaluated in 15 patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Gas exchange was assessed during quiet breathing at rest before and after 15 minutes of breathing 80 percent He-20 percent O2 mixtures in all patients. Functional residual capacity (FRC) determined during argon (Ar) washing studies fell significantly while breathing He-O2, but we did not find significant changes in minute ventilation, tidal volume, respiratory frequency, or inspiratory or expiratory timing. Eleven patients showed decreases in arterial PCO2 and CO2 excretion during resting breathing on He-O2. Expiratory flows were increased at a given lung volume during He-O2 breathing as expected. Apparently, mechanical work of breathing was decreased in patients with severe COPD while breathing He-O2, leading to a reduction in VCO2 and improvement in overall alveolar ventilation. These findings lend support to the therapeutic use of He-O2 under some conditions in patients with severe COPD.",0,0,0,0,0,0
789186,Tranexamic acid and upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage--a double-blind trial,"The efficacy of antifibrinolytic therapy in the management of acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage has been investigated in a double-blind clinical trial. Two-hundred patients were studied using tranexamic acid, a potent antifibrinolytic agent. Of these, 103 were in the treatment group and 97 in the control group. Patients were analysed to determine severity of initial blood loss, transfusion requirements, together with the incidence of recurrent bleeding, surgical intervention, and death. Final diagnosis as to the site of bleeding was arrived at using endoscopy, barium studies, and the findings at operation and necropsy. The groups were well matched as regards severity of initial haemorrhage, age, sex, aetiological diagnosis, and precipitating factors. A significant difference was observed in the requirement for surgical intervention to control continuing or recurrent haemorrhage. Twenty-three of 97 in the control group and seven of 103 in the treatment group required surgery. There appeared to be a reduction in the transfusion rate after the first three days of hospitalization in the treatment group. There were no significant differences in mortality or in side-effects between the two groups.",1,1,1,0,0,3
395630, Tranexamic acid in massive haemorrhage from the upper gastrointestinal tract: a double-blind study. ,"In a double-blind trial of tranexamic acid in massive upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 76 patients were treated with the active drug and 73 patients with placebo. The doses were 1 g intravenously six times daily for a maximum of 3 days, followed by 1.5 g orally four times daily for a maximum of 4 days. The treatment group and the placebo group were comparable with respect to mean age, diagnoses and laboratory tests but differed slightly with respect to sex and alcohol consumption. The transfusion requirement in the treatment group was less than in the placebo group during the first days after admission, the difference being significant on the second day after admission. Ten patients in the treatment group and 18 patients in the placebo group were operated on. Eleven patients in the treatment group and 12 patients in the placebo group died. In the tranexamic-acid-treated group fewer operations were performed and significantly less blood was needed. It therefore seems highly likely that tranexamic acid has a beneficial effect, although small.",1,1,1,0,-1,2

6343868, Cimetidine and tranexamic acid in the treatment of acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract bleedin,"We studied the effects of tranexamic acid (an antifibrinolytic agent) and cimetidine on acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract bleeding in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in 775 patients with hematemesis or melena or both. Mortality was significantly reduced in patients receiving either tranexamic acid (mortality, 6.3 per cent) or cimetidine (7.7 per cent), as compared with patients receiving placebo (13.5 per cent) (P = 0.0092 for tranexamic acid vs. placebo, P = 0.045 for cimetidine vs. placebo). Ninety-nine patients were withdrawn before the code was broken, mainly because their primary illness was considered not to be due to acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract bleeding. Mortality among those withdrawn was high (22 per cent), and their exclusion reduced death rates to 4 per cent in those given tranexamic acid, 8 per cent in those given cimetidine, and 11 per cent in those given placebo (P = 0.0072 for tranexamic acid vs. placebo, P greater than 0.50 for cimetidine vs. placebo). The reduced mortality associated with tranexamic acid was detectable at both participating hospitals and in most of the main subgroups of patients classified according to site of bleeding. However, treatment with this agent was not associated with any decrease in the rate of rebleeding or the need for operation.",1,1,1,1,0,4
3101804,Tranexamic acid as an aid to reducing blood transfusion requirements in gastric and duodenal bleeding,"A prospective randomised double blind study examined the effect of the antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid compared with placebo in 154 patients bleeding from verified benign lesions in the stomach or duodenum or both. Three out of 72 patients receiving tranexamic acid underwent emergency surgery compared with 15 out of 82 given placebo (p = 0.010). Nineteen patients receiving placebo rebled during their admission as compared with 10 in the active treatment group (p = 0.097). Blood transfusion requirements were significantly reduced by tranexamic acid (p = 0.018). Side effects occurred in six patients, of which an uncomplicated deep venous thrombosis was the most severe. Tranexamic acid reduces the blood transfusion requirement and need for emergency surgery in patients bleeding from a benign gastric or duodenal lesion.",1,1,1,1,-1,3
8649915,Oral dexamethasone in the treatment of croup: 0.15 mg/kg versus 0.3 mg/kg versus 0.6 mg/kg,"The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of a single dose of oral dexamethasone of varying sizes in 120 children hospitalized with croup in two sequential double blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials (Trials A and B). The study was conducted in the Emergency Department Observation Ward of a tertiary pediatric hospital. One hundred and twenty children (age range 6 to 160 months) hospitalized with croup participated. Baseline characteristics for the two groups in each trial were similar. In Trial A 60 children received either 0.6 or 0.3 mg/kg dexamethasone syrup; in Trial B 60 children received either 0.3 or 0.15 mg/ kg dexamethasone syrup. Duration of hospitalization, reduction in croup scores, and adrenaline usage were evaluated. Median duration of hospitalization was similar for children in Trial A (7 and 8 hr), and in Trial B (9 and 9 hr). Croup scores following treatment did not differ and were significantly lower than initial scores for all groups and in each trial. Other outcome measures were similar for the two groups in each trial, including need for nebulized adrenaline, numbers of patients admitted to intensive care, rate of return to medical care with reoccurrence of croup, and readmission to hospital with croup following discharge from hospital. We conclude that oral dexamethasone in a dose of 0.15 mg/kg is as effective as 0.3 or 0.6 mg/kg in relieving symptoms and results in a similar duration of hospitalization in children with croup.",1,1,1,0,0,3
2156984,Aciclovir treatment of varicella in otherwise healthy children.,"Study objective: To determine whether acyclovir administered orally affects the duration and severity of varicella in otherwise normal children.Design: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.Setting: Patients' residence and university hospital clinic.Patients: One hundred five children between 5 and 16 years of age with laboratory-confirmed varicella entered the study. Of the 102 who were included in the final analysis, 50 received acyclovir and 52 received placebo.Intervention: Placebo or acyclovir was given orally four times daily, for 5 to 7 days. The acyclovir dose was adjusted as follows: 5 to 7 years of age, 20 mg/kg; 7 to 12 years, 15 mg/kg; and 12 to 16 years, 10 mg/kg.Measurements and main results: Acyclovir recipients, compared with the placebo group, defervesced sooner (median, 1 day vs 2 days; p = 0.001), experienced onset of cutaneous healing sooner, as reflected by a decrease in number of lesions (median, 3 days vs 2 days; p = 0.002), and had fewer skin lesions (median, 500 vs 336; p = 0.02). Acyclovir did not significantly change the rate of complications of varicella (10% in the acyclovir group vs 13.5% among placebo subjects). Adverse drug effects were not observed. Acyclovir recipients had lower geometric mean serum antibody titers to varicella-zoster virus than their placebo counterparts 4 weeks after the onset of illness, but antibody titers in both groups were similar 1 year later.Conclusions: These results provide evidence that acyclovir is useful and well tolerated for treatment of varicella in otherwise healthy children.",1,1,1,1,0,4
1313098,Acyclovir treatment of varicella in otherwise healthy adolescents. The Collaborative Acyclovir Varicella Study Group,"Study objective: To determine whether orally administered acyclovir is of therapeutic benefit for varicella in otherwise healthy adolescents, and to compare the severity of the disease in adolescents with that in younger children.Design: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.Setting: Patients' homes and university hospital clinics.Patients: Sixty-eight adolescents between 13 and 18 years of age with varicella entered the study. Of the 62 adolescents with laboratory-confirmed varicella who were included in the final analysis, 31 received acyclovir and 31 received placebo.Interventions: Placebo or an 800 mg acyclovir tablet was given orally four times daily for 5 days, beginning within 24 hours of onset of rash.Measurements and main results: Acyclovir recipients had significant reductions in times to cessation of new lesion formation (p less than 0.001), maximum number of lesions (p = 0.019), and defervescence (p = 0.045). Mean constitutional illness score was significantly reduced on day 4 (0.5 vs 1.5, p = 0.05), as was the mean number of residual hypopigmented lesions present on 28-day follow-up examination (22.7 vs 92.7, p = 0.018). Two complications, both bacterial superinfections, occurred in placebo recipients. Adverse experiences and varicella-zoster virus antibody titers measured 28 days after enrollment were similar in both treatment groups. Comparison of placebo recipients with children 2 to 12 years of age participating in a companion study indicated that varicella is more severe in adolescents: mean maximum total lesions (421 vs 347, p = 0.003), mean maximum constitutional illness score (3.1 vs 2.2, p = 0.032), and mean number of residual lesions (92.7 vs 33.2, p = 0.01) were all greater in the adolescent population.Conclusions: Oral acyclovir therapy is safe and effective for treatment of varicella in otherwise healthy adolescents; this may be an appropriate subgroup for treatment with antiviral drugs because the disease is more severe in them than in younger children.",1,1,1,0,1,4
